       " 'My husband loved SCB in all his incarnations (Ali G., Borat, Bruno, and that guy from Who is America). He\\'d quote parts of Bruno (\"But first, more dancing with Bruno!\") as he\\'d dance around me in the kitchen. He\\'d quote parts of an interview SCB did with Dick Cheney, as I rolled my eyes. Every couple of years or so, he\\'d put on Bruno or Borat, and laugh, and laugh, while I just shook my head. In short, he reverted from a mature 35 year old man, into a a teen, because of this one comedian. I kind of hated it and really didn\\'t see the appeal of Cohen\\'s comedy which I found crude and sometimes downright offensive (i.e., \"In my country, they would go crazy for these two. That one, not so much.\"). Until this Borat 2020 film, that is.Knowing he was such a fan, the evening of the day the film came out, I grilled him a porterhouse steak in bourbon and pecans, with a baked potato smothered in broccoli and cheese sauce, and relegated myself to sit through this new Borat without looking too bored or condescending.Two things happened.One, my husband, laughed several times, of course, but he did so less heartily than he had at most of SCB\\'s prior work, and he never rewinded it to re-watch an especially funny part.Two, I loved it.This Borat film is hilarious!!! And not only is it both, in your face, and subtly hilarious, but it has sooo much heart, it nearly brought me to tears. Even the infinitely ill-informed guys he quarantined with, made me want to go out and hug a redneck.So, if you\\'re here wondering whether you should watch it (although I don\\'t think that\\'s what anyone does anymore), I suggest you do so. The worst that can happen is that you\\'ll laugh. Since when is that a bad thing? The best that can happen is that you\\'ll laugh and cry at seeing the United States in such a dire and chaotic state, and so far from united, that you will walk away with a desire to one day make it united, as the greatest gift ever to ourselves and our kids.',\n",
       " \"What's even funnier than the movie itself, is seeing people cry about it. I mean, damn, Cohen just exposes the stuff, he doesn't make them say or do what they say and do. If you're mad at anyone, be mad at the buffoons caught on tape. Or on second thought, keep being mad here, cause its hella hilarious.Great movie. Had richer, deeper laughs than the first, though not as many. Plus, it's on Amazon, so you can basically watch it for what you already pay or get yourself a free trial.Great s#!^!\",\n",
       " \"For those saying Giuliani was just tucking in his shirt, why lay down on a bed to do so instead of STANDING UP? And that, folks, is part of the genius of this film: that is shows you, live on video what's going on, and lets those who want to continue to lie to themselves, to continue to do so, while being laughed at by others. Don't miss it.\",\n",
